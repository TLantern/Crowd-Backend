From the revolutionary works in electricity and anatomy to the unexplored Arctic landscapes and the rise of artificial intelligence, Frankenstein remains a timely reflection of humanity's struggle with creation. We also explore the novel's ongoing impact on popular culture, showing how the monster has become a symbol of both horror and human ambition. Presented by UNT Libraries Special Collections, this exhibit draws from original sources spanning the 18th through the 21st century, including scientific texts, medical illustrations, and artifacts. Exhibition will be on view from October 3 - November 1 at the UNT CoLab.",

Please join us! Sept. 2–Dec. 12, 2025 CVAD Gallery, Room 160 UNT Art Building Address: 1201 W. Mulberry St., Denton, TX 76201 | Map & Directions Hours: Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday: Noon–5 p.m. | Thursday: Noon–8 p.m. The University of North Texas College of Visual Arts and Design will open its first \"CVAD Faculty/Teaching Juried Exhibition\" since 2020 on Sept. 2, 2025, transforming the CVAD Gallery into a showcase of artistic vision from the educators who shape the college's creative community. Featuring 34 works by 32 faculty and teaching artists, the exhibition offers a rare opportunity for audiences to encounter the art-making practices that thrive beyond the classroom. Visitors will see the breadth of CVAD's creative disciplines — from the tactile allure of hand-thrown ceramics to the precise craftsmanship of fashion design, the layered narratives of artist books and exhibition catalogs, and the immersive environments of installation art. Drawn from across all CVAD departments — Foundations, Interdisciplinary Art and Design Studies, Design, Studio, Art Education, and Art History — the works on view embody the multiplicity of ideas, materials, and approaches that define the college's ethos. The \"Faculty/Teaching Juried Exhibition\" runs through Dec. 12 at the CVAD Gallery, inviting art lovers to see the university's artists as they see themselves: working, questioning, and creating at the edge of possibility.",

      "description": "Photonic and optoelectronic approaches to thermal management Dr. Aaswath Raman, The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Abstract: Thermal management is a central challenge facing next-generation microelectronic technologies. from the chip-scale to the data center level. In this context, controlling and leveraging light emission through passive or active means remains a comparatively underexplored approach. In this talk, I will introduce our work on thermal photonic strategies to control the spectral and directional characteristics of thermal emission over infrared wavelengths. In particular, I will show how a heavily-doped III-V-material-based platform allows us to enable tunable frequency and angle selectivity in emission across both polarizations by harnessing Epsilon-near-zero and effective Mu-near-zero behavior these systems can be engineered to support. Furthermore, I will show how Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation can be violated in these systems over broad wavelengths by magnetic-field induced nonreciprocity, enabling new capabilities for radiative heat transfer. As one application of these capabilities, I will summarize our group's recent work on radiative cooling technologies for passive, non-evaporative cooling and its use for building-scale energy applications. Finally, I will introduce our ongoing work on unconventional optoelectronic technologies enabled by LEDs. This includes chip-scale optoelectronic voltage boost conversion using a novel epitaxial III-V architecture, as well as electroluminescent cooling enabled by LEDs for cryogenic cooling applications.",

From the revolutionary works in electricity and anatomy to the unexplored Arctic landscapes and the rise of artificial intelligence, Frankenstein remains a timely reflection of humanity's struggle with creation. We also explore the novel's ongoing impact on popular culture, showing how the monster has become a symbol of both horror and human ambition. Presented by UNT Libraries Special Collections, this exhibit draws from original sources spanning the 18th through the 21st century, including scientific texts, medical illustrations, and artifacts.

Please join us! Sept. 2–Dec. 12, 2025 CVAD Gallery, Room 160 UNT Art Building Address: 1201 W. Mulberry St., Denton, TX 76201 | Map & Directions Hours: Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday: Noon–5 p.m. | Thursday: Noon–8 p.m. The University of North Texas College of Visual Arts and Design will open its first \"CVAD Faculty/Teaching Juried Exhibition\" since 2020 on Sept. 2, 2025, transforming the CVAD Gallery into a showcase of artistic vision from the educators who shape the college's creative community. Featuring 34 works by 32 faculty and teaching artists, the exhibition offers a rare opportunity for audiences to encounter the art-making practices that thrive beyond the classroom. Visitors will see the breadth of CVAD's creative disciplines — from the tactile allure of hand-thrown ceramics to the precise craftsmanship of fashion design, the layered narratives of artist books and exhibition catalogs, and the immersive environments of installation art. Drawn from across all CVAD departments — Foundations, Interdisciplinary Art and Design Studies, Design, Studio, Art Education, and Art History — the works on view embody the multiplicity of ideas, materials, and approaches that define the college's ethos. The \"Faculty/Teaching Juried Exhibition\" runs through Dec. 12 at the CVAD Gallery, inviting art lovers to see the university's artists as they see themselves: working, questioning, and creating at the edge of possibility.",
