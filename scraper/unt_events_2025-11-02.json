And there are laughs galore in perennial favorite \"Sideways Stories from Wayside School\", adapted from three chapter books (\"Sideways Stories from Wayside School\", \"Wayside School Is Falling Down\", and \"Wayside School Gets a Little Strange\") Accidentally built sideways and standing thirty stories high (the builder said he was very sorry for the mistake), Wayside School has some of the wackiest classes in town, especially on the thirtieth floor. That's where you'll meet Bebe, the fastest draw in art class; John, who only reads upside down; Myron, the best class president ever; and Sammy, the new kid—he's a real rat. Enter the world of Wayside School in this wacky adaptation by Louis Sachar and laugh your way through a not-so-typical school day! So, what are you waiting for? Come visit Wayside School. *Summary from Susan Schulman Literacy Agency* Written by Louis Sachar Adapted for the stage by John Olive Directed by Ashley Puckett Gonzales Run Time: 85 minutes, no intermission",

      "description": "Important Links and Information UNT Opera Presents Rachmaninoff and Puccini: Tales from the Silk Road This unique double bill production of Rachmaninoff's Aleko and Puccini's Gianni Schicchi journeys across continents, threading together stories of passion, exile, and deception through the rich tapestry of human expression. Inspired by the literary giants Pushkin and Dante, these operas are presented as tales rediscovered along the historic Silk Road — where ideas, cultures, and technologies once flowed freely. A community of Romani traders from Pushkin's poem The Gypsies and a conniving family of merchants inspired by Dante's Divine Comedy, are woven together by the historic trading route, bringing their characters to life in vivid operatic form. In Aleko, a restless man seeks freedom among Romani traders, only to be consumed by jealousy and the very passions he hoped would liberate him — an echo of Pushkin's poetic meditation on outsiderhood and fate. In contrast, Gianni Schicchi delivers biting satire as a clever commoner outwits Florence's greedy elite, in a comic turn straight from Dante's Inferno. The power of cunning speech — and the written will — becomes both a weapon and salvation. Together, these operas examine how stories travel, transform, and endure — from a song sung by a campfire to a will written by candlelight, from the steppes of Asia to Renaissance Florence — reminding us that human nature, in all its folly, transcends time.

Please join us! Sept. 2–Dec. 12, 2025 CVAD Gallery, Room 160 UNT Art Building Address: 1201 W. Mulberry St., Denton, TX 76201 | Map & Directions Hours: Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday: Noon–5 p.m. | Thursday: Noon–8 p.m. The University of North Texas College of Visual Arts and Design will open its first \"CVAD Faculty/Teaching Juried Exhibition\" since 2020 on Sept. 2, 2025, transforming the CVAD Gallery into a showcase of artistic vision from the educators who shape the college's creative community. Featuring 34 works by 32 faculty and teaching artists, the exhibition offers a rare opportunity for audiences to encounter the art-making practices that thrive beyond the classroom. Visitors will see the breadth of CVAD's creative disciplines — from the tactile allure of hand-thrown ceramics to the precise craftsmanship of fashion design, the layered narratives of artist books and exhibition catalogs, and the immersive environments of installation art. Drawn from across all CVAD departments — Foundations, Interdisciplinary Art and Design Studies, Design, Studio, Art Education, and Art History — the works on view embody the multiplicity of ideas, materials, and approaches that define the college's ethos. The \"Faculty/Teaching Juried Exhibition\" runs through Dec. 12 at the CVAD Gallery, inviting art lovers to see the university's artists as they see themselves: working, questioning, and creating at the edge of possibility.",

      "description": "A Novel Electron Beam Approach for Controlled Graphene Hydrogenation Dr. Jose Perez, University of North Texas (UNT) Abstract: This study presents a novel electron-beam–based method for controlled hydrogenation of graphene, offering a potential pathway toward hydrogen-storage applications and tunable functionalization. Using electron irradiation in both ultra-high vacuum (UHV) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) environments, graphene drums were exposed to controlled electron doses to induce surface reactions between adsorbed water molecules and the graphene lattice. Raman spectroscopy revealed significant increases in the ID /IG ratio, with values up to 6.3 for completely covered graphene drums, indicating the formation of sp&sup3;-type defects consistent with hydrogenated carbon sites. Complementary X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed peak broadening and energy shifts associated with sp&sup3; bonding after irradiation, which reverted upon annealing at 250–270 &deg;C—demonstrating the reversible nature of hydrogenation. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoindentation studies showed that low irradiation doses increased the elastic modulus, while higher doses decreased it, with post-annealing recovery suggesting lattice healing. Temperature-programmed desorption and planned STM experiments aim to further characterize the adsorption and desorption behavior of hydrogen species on irradiated graphene. The results support a model in which electron-induced dissociation of adsorbed water or hydroxyl groups drives localized hydrogenation. This electron-beam approach thus provides a controllable, repeatable technique for graphene modification, with promising implications for energy storage technologies and nanoscale device engineering.",

      "description": "Objective: To complete funny challenges while staying as quiet as possible—like you're in a library. The quieter the group, the higher your score. Players and Setup: Number of players: 4–8 works best. Equipment: A deck of cards (or slips of paper). Challenge cards or a list of tasks (you can prepare these in advance). A noise meter (optional – can use a phone app or just have a \"judge\" listen). Props depending on the challenges (e.g., water, food, rubber bands, tape, balloons, etc.). A table to sit around. Game Setup: Arrange the players at a table, library-style. Designate one player as the dealer or rotate who deals each round. Prepare challenge cards — write fun, weird tasks on paper. Shuffle both the playing cards and the challenge cards. How to Play (Step-by-Step) 1. Deal the Cards Each player draws one card from the deck. One card (for example, the \"losing\" card) will indicate who must perform the challenge. Example: if you use 6 players, have one card be the \"loser\" (like the Joker or Ace of Spades). 2. Reveal the \"Loser\" Everyone flips their cards at the same time. Whoever gets the losing card has to perform the challenge drawn from the challenge deck. 3. Perform the Challenge — Silently! The chosen player does the challenge while everyone must remain silent—no laughing, yelling, or reacting loudly. The others can silently encourage or react, but noise penalties apply if they laugh too loudly! 4. Noise Penalty If the group makes too much noise (decided by a noise meter or judge's discretion), the team loses that round. If they stay quiet, they earn a point. 5. Rotate and Continue.",
