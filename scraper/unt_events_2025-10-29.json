From the revolutionary works in electricity and anatomy to the unexplored Arctic landscapes and the rise of artificial intelligence, Frankenstein remains a timely reflection of humanity's struggle with creation. We also explore the novel's ongoing impact on popular culture, showing how the monster has become a symbol of both horror and human ambition. Presented by UNT Libraries Special Collections, this exhibit draws from original sources spanning the 18th through the 21st century, including scientific texts, medical illustrations, and artifacts.

Please join us! Sept. 2–Dec. 12, 2025 CVAD Gallery, Room 160 UNT Art Building Address: 1201 W. Mulberry St., Denton, TX 76201 | Map & Directions Hours: Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday: Noon–5 p.m. | Thursday: Noon–8 p.m. The University of North Texas College of Visual Arts and Design will open its first \"CVAD Faculty/Teaching Juried Exhibition\" since 2020 on Sept. 2, 2025, transforming the CVAD Gallery into a showcase of artistic vision from the educators who shape the college's creative community. Featuring 34 works by 32 faculty and teaching artists, the exhibition offers a rare opportunity for audiences to encounter the art-making practices that thrive beyond the classroom. Visitors will see the breadth of CVAD's creative disciplines — from the tactile allure of hand-thrown ceramics to the precise craftsmanship of fashion design, the layered narratives of artist books and exhibition catalogs, and the immersive environments of installation art. Drawn from across all CVAD departments — Foundations, Interdisciplinary Art and Design Studies, Design, Studio, Art Education, and Art History — the works on view embody the multiplicity of ideas, materials, and approaches that define the college's ethos. The \"Faculty/Teaching Juried Exhibition\" runs through Dec. 12 at the CVAD Gallery, inviting art lovers to see the university's artists as they see themselves: working, questioning, and creating at the edge of possibility.",

In addition, we offer books on writing topics to help members of the group with their productivity. These books include How to Write A Lot by Silvia, Becoming an Academic Writer: 50 Exercises for Paced, Productive, and Powerful Writing by Goodson, Professors as Writers by Boice, Writing Your Journal Article in Twelve Weeks: A Guide to Academic Publishing Success by Belcher, and Deep Work by Newport.

      "description": "Our latest gallery exhibition is Frankenstein: How Science and Culture Shaped a Monster. This exhibit explores Mary Shelley's Frankenstein as a reflection of the scientific, medical, and cultural anxieties of her time. From the revolutionary works in electricity and anatomy to the unexplored Arctic landscapes and the rise of artificial intelligence, Frankenstein remains a timely reflection of humanity's struggle with creation. We also explore the novel's ongoing impact on popular culture, showing how the monster has become a symbol of both horror and human ambition. Presented by UNT Libraries Special Collections, this exhibit draws from original sources spanning the 18th through the 21st century, including scientific texts, medical illustrations, and artifacts. Exhibition will be on view from October 3 - November 1 at the UNT CoLab.",

Please join us! Sept. 2–Dec. 12, 2025 CVAD Gallery, Room 160 UNT Art Building Address: 1201 W. Mulberry St., Denton, TX 76201 | Map & Directions Hours: Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday: Noon–5 p.m. | Thursday: Noon–8 p.m. The University of North Texas College of Visual Arts and Design will open its first \"CVAD Faculty/Teaching Juried Exhibition\" since 2020 on Sept. 2, 2025, transforming the CVAD Gallery into a showcase of artistic vision from the educators who shape the college's creative community. Featuring 34 works by 32 faculty and teaching artists, the exhibition offers a rare opportunity for audiences to encounter the art-making practices that thrive beyond the classroom. Visitors will see the breadth of CVAD's creative disciplines — from the tactile allure of hand-thrown ceramics to the precise craftsmanship of fashion design, the layered narratives of artist books and exhibition catalogs, and the immersive environments of installation art. Drawn from across all CVAD departments — Foundations, Interdisciplinary Art and Design Studies, Design, Studio, Art Education, and Art History — the works on view embody the multiplicity of ideas, materials, and approaches that define the college's ethos. The \"Faculty/Teaching Juried Exhibition\" runs through Dec. 12 at the CVAD Gallery, inviting art lovers to see the university's artists as they see themselves: working, questioning, and creating at the edge of possibility.",
