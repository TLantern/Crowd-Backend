The culmination of this hard work is the awarding of tenure and promotion for achieving excellence in teaching, research, and service. As one embarks on the journey toward tenure and/or promotion, we encourage faculty members and those administrators and staff professionals who support them to attend one of our periodic P&T workshops moderated by senior academic administrators such as UNT's provost and president. Of course, it is also important to review carefully the promotion and tenure process, guidelines, and deadlines as provided on this website and within one's college or school. Please contact the applicable college, school, and department for specific guidelines related to the promotion and tenure process, application and resources. Faculty Success typically hosts two promotion and tenure workshops each year, moderated by senior academic administrators such as the vice provost for faculty success, the provost and the president.

Authentic assessments are linked to positive attitudes, an increase in engagement, and intended learning outcomes (James & Casidy, 2018; Jopp, 2020; Way et al., 2021).

Please join us! Sept. 2–Dec. 12, 2025 CVAD Gallery, Room 160 UNT Art Building Address: 1201 W. Mulberry St., Denton, TX 76201 | Map & Directions Hours: Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday: Noon–5 p.m. | Thursday: Noon–8 p.m. The University of North Texas College of Visual Arts and Design will open its first \"CVAD Faculty/Teaching Juried Exhibition\" since 2020 on Sept. 2, 2025, transforming the CVAD Gallery into a showcase of artistic vision from the educators who shape the college's creative community. Featuring 34 works by 32 faculty and teaching artists, the exhibition offers a rare opportunity for audiences to encounter the art-making practices that thrive beyond the classroom. Visitors will see the breadth of CVAD's creative disciplines — from the tactile allure of hand-thrown ceramics to the precise craftsmanship of fashion design, the layered narratives of artist books and exhibition catalogs, and the immersive environments of installation art. Drawn from across all CVAD departments — Foundations, Interdisciplinary Art and Design Studies, Design, Studio, Art Education, and Art History — the works on view embody the multiplicity of ideas, materials, and approaches that define the college's ethos. The \"Faculty/Teaching Juried Exhibition\" runs through Dec. 12 at the CVAD Gallery, inviting art lovers to see the university's artists as they see themselves: working, questioning, and creating at the edge of possibility.",

      "description": "Dr. Mario Affatigato, Professor in Physics Department at Coe College will give a seminar titled \"The Electronic Conductivity of Vanadate Glasses, and Some Glassmaking With Levitation\" to the interested faculty and students at Discovery Park. Abstract Electronically conducting glasses have recently become more important due to their use in detectors. We report on our work developing vanadate glass families that can be tailored to achieve specific values of electronic conductivity. The focus will be on controlling the ratio of V4+/V5+ through the use of additive modifiers (like elemental tellurium); melting atmospheres; and other preparation conditions. Conductivity results were attained over a span of temperatures up to 200 &deg;C. The samples were structurally characterized using FTIR, Raman, EPR, XRD, and colorimetry (for V4+ measurements). The results are also compared to previous work that indicated an optimal V4+ concentration that varied from the 50% mark and are also placed in the context of various \"hopping\" conductivity models. We also report on glass ceramics and other modifications of vanadium-based glasses. Some of the reported glasses were mounted on prototype detectors and tested at the Fermi National Accelerator facility and at CERN, and we discuss their improved efficiency under various beam conditions. We will also discuss our separate work using aerolevitation to manufacture glasses at high temperatures and under non-equilibrium conditions This work was supported by Argonne National Laboratory under contract 3F-32104, by the National Science Foundation through grants DMR-CER-1407404, DMR-CER-2203142, and DMR-CER-1746230. Bio Prof. Mario Affatigato obtained his undergraduate degree from Coe College in 1989, followed by his Ph.D. from Vanderbilt University in 1995. He has developed a research effort primarily investigating the relationship between the optical properties and structure of glassy materials. He has worked with over 90 undergraduates in projects that include laser-induced modification and exotic manufacturing methods like aerolevitation. His research primarily deals with oxide glasses, especially vanadates, borates, and samples with heavy metals. Prof. Affatigato is a past recipient of the APS Prize for Research at an Undergraduate Institution, a PECASE award from the National Science Foundation (NSF), a SEED Award from the Research Corporation, as well as other research grants from industry, NSF and the Research Corporation. He is a fellow of the American Ceramic Society and the UK Society of Glass Technology, and a Research Corporation Cottrell Scholar. Currently he holds the Fran Allison and Francis Halpin Professorship at Coe College, is the Editor in Chief of the International Journal of Applied Glass Science, and in October will start his term as the President of the American Ceramic Society for 2025-26.",

Together we will explore mindfulness, emotions, anxiety, stress, and negative thoughts in a relaxing and fun way. In this space, we will engage in artistic activities to reflect on our needs and experiences using colors and creativity from our minds, bodies, and spirits for the intention of healing. Each week we will engage in different expressive art activities using different mediums such as acrylic paint, markers, watercolors, magazines, oil pastels, and color pencils. You are not required to share your artwork but there is space given at the end of the workshop to process the artwork, activity and experience. Throughout the workshop there will be soothing background music being played and instructions are given in the beginning and can be repeated throughout the workshop. If you are struggling with the activity the host will assist you with the workshop to help you feel more comfortable or capable of engaging with the activity.",

The presentation identifies critical gaps between traditional software testing and AI model validation, emphasizing the need for metrics that ensure robustness, fairness, and reliability. The talk will present methods such as metamorphic testing, transfer learning evaluation, and data-centric analysis to address dataset redundancy, bias, and domain shift. Through a case study on medical concept normalization, it demonstrates how dataset overlap can inflate performance metrics and proposes data quality evaluation and LLM-based data augmentation to improve reliability. Additionally, the talk explores formal verification of AI-generated artifacts, focusing on prompt validation using model checking, few-shot learning, and temporal logic reasoning to ensure specification correctness and sufficiency. Finally, it introduces a unified perspective that connects model testing, data validation, and innovation measurement, paving the way for more trustworthy and transparent AI systems. Dr. Junhua Ding is the Reinburg Endowed Professor in Data Science and Chair of the Anuradha & Vikas Sinha Department of Data Science at the University of North Texas. A scholar, innovator, and leader, Dr. Ding's work bridges the gap between academic research and real-world impact. His research focuses on data-centric artificial intelligence, biomedical computing, software security, and automated software engineering, and he has authored more than 130 peer-reviewed publications in these areas and secured more than $6 million in research grants from federal agencies and industry as a PI and coPI.",
