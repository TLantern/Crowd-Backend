Mulberry St., Denton, TX 76201 | Map & Directions Hours: Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday: Noon–5 p.m. | Thursday: Noon–8 p.m. The University of North Texas College of Visual Arts and Design will open its first \"CVAD Faculty/Teaching Juried Exhibition\" since 2020 on Sept. 2, 2025, transforming the CVAD Gallery into a showcase of artistic vision from the educators who shape the college's creative community. Featuring 34 works by 32 faculty and teaching artists, the exhibition offers a rare opportunity for audiences to encounter the art-making practices that thrive beyond the classroom. Visitors will see the breadth of CVAD's creative disciplines — from the tactile allure of hand-thrown ceramics to the precise craftsmanship of fashion design, the layered narratives of artist books and exhibition catalogs, and the immersive environments of installation art. Drawn from across all CVAD departments — Foundations, Interdisciplinary Art and Design Studies, Design, Studio, Art Education, and Art History — the works on view embody the multiplicity of ideas, materials, and approaches that define the college's ethos. The \"Faculty/Teaching Juried Exhibition\" runs through Dec. 12 at the CVAD Gallery, inviting art lovers to see the university's artists as they see themselves: working, questioning, and creating at the edge of possibility.",

      "description": "Dr. Xiulei \"David\" Ji, the Bert and Emelyn Christensen Professor of Chemistry at Oregon State University, will give a seminar titled \"From Ion Charge Carriers in Storage Batteries to a New Family of Cathodes for High-Energy Power Batteries\" to the interested faculty and students at the Discovery Park. Abstract Over the past thirteen years, my research has sought scalable, low-cost battery chemistries for energy storage by navigating through the landscape of ion charge carriers. The chemistry of storage batteries has not yet been settled, and their feasibility must be explored by pushing the boundaries of existing battery designs. Our work began with investigations of sodium and potassium storage in carbon anodes for non-aqueous batteries and later expanded to aqueous systems employing charge carriers such as protons, ammonium, iron, and zinc. In aqueous batteries, we uncovered fundamental correlations between solvation structures and the thermodynamic reactivity of water in electrolytes, as well as engineering approaches to passivate metal anode surfaces for extended cycle life. We have enjoyed revealing new and often unexpected chemical properties of water. In parallel, we learned that anions play critical roles in enabling unconventional and highly reversible electrode reactions. Building on these insights, our focus has shifted to anions as charge carriers and redox centers. A recent effort involves integrating small oxyanions directly as active mass within electrode composites to enhance energy density. This evolution marks our transition from ion-carrier-centric research to electrode-centric design, as we now explore new composite cathodes that challenge the status quo of the Li-ion and Na-ion battery industry. Bio Prof. Xiulei \"David\" Ji is the Bert and Emelyn Christensen Professor of Chemistry at Oregon State University. His research focuses on devising new electrochemical reactions for high-performance and low-cost energy storage. Prof. Ji has been recognized as a Highly Cited Researcher by the Web of Science Group each year since 2019, with over 47,000 citations and an H-index of 98 (Google Scholar). He received the NSF CAREER Award in 2016 and has been named a Scialog Fellow by the Research Corporation for Science Advancement. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry. He currently serves as an Associate Editor of Carbon Energy (Wiley). Prof. Ji earned his B.Sc. in Chemistry from Jilin University in 2003 and his Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Waterloo in 2009. From 2010 to 2012, he was an NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of California, Santa Barbara.",

In this group it is important to focus on the process of creating, and not the product of what you create. Together we will explore mindfulness, emotions, anxiety, stress, and negative thoughts in a relaxing and fun way. In this space, we will engage in artistic activities to reflect on our needs and experiences using colors and creativity from our minds, bodies, and spirits for the intention of healing. Each week we will engage in different expressive art activities using different mediums such as acrylic paint, markers, watercolors, magazines, oil pastels, and color pencils. You are not required to share your artwork but there is space given at the end of the workshop to process the artwork, activity and experience. Throughout the workshop there will be soothing background music being played and instructions are given in the beginning and can be repeated throughout the workshop. If you are struggling with the activity the host will assist you with the workshop to help you feel more comfortable or capable of engaging with the activity.",

Each year, the executive board chooses a medical cause to raise money and awareness for, from AIDS to cancer and, this year, neurological disorders. Students perform a variety of talents as friends and family gather to watch their performance, providing a night of fun for all attendees and opportunity to bring medical issues to the limelight in a manner in which they would not have previously. Oftentimes, learning about the medical world and figuring out how to get involved can be jarring, especially if one's career path/interests don't necessarily align with medicine. We put on Aid The Cause to alleviate this burden. Instead of random general assemblies and informationals, we provide a talent-filled night where students can come to not only learn about various medical issues but find out how they can help. The entire event is run by the student body, from decorations to event promotion to the performers, giving the student body an opportunity to get involved not only with TMS but the medical world as a whole. Enhancing UNT's reputation of prioritizing social responsibility and community involvement, Aid The Cause fosters a sense of community amongst students, engaging them not only with the medical world but each other.",

      "description": "Dr. Rajeev Gupta, Associate Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at North Carolina State University will give a seminar titled \"Overcoming Corrosion Challenges by Engineering Suitable Microstructures\" to the interested faculty and students at Discovery Park. Abstract Reducing material consumption, increasing the useful service life, and promoting recycling are critical components of creating a sustainable future. Corrosion reduces the useful life of engineering components, necessitating the production of more materials. Additionally, corrosion-resistant metallic materials are often heavier, resulting in higher carbon footprints. As a result, the need to develop lightweight, high-strength, and corrosion-resistant materials is steadily increasing. The properties of engineering alloys are often limited by conventional compositions and manufacturing technologies. The speaker's recent work has demonstrated the development of alloys with properties that exceed traditional limits, achieved through precise control of microstructure and composition. Specific examples of high-energy ball-milled alloys, additively manufactured alloys and multi-principal element alloys will be presented, showing how high corrosion resistance can be achieved through the design of unique microstructures. Bio Rajeev Gupta is an Associate Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at North Carolina State University. He received B.Tech. in Materials and Metallurgical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur and Ph.D. in Materials Engineering from Monash University. Before joining the faculty at NC State, he was an Assistant Professor at the University of Akron. Rajeev's primary research interests lie in the broad areas of corrosion and materials engineering. His research group focuses on corrosion science, high temperature oxidation, understanding the structure–processing–property–performance relationships in metallic materials, and surface electrochemistry. This fundamental research aims to support the development of new materials, corrosion characterization techniques, material processing technologies, and life prediction models. His research is supported by the NSF, DOD, DOE, ONR, and industries. Rajeev serves as an Associate Editor of the Journal of the Electrochemical Society and is the recipient of the NSF CAREER Award, ECS Rusty Award for Mid-Career Excellence, AMPP Educator Award in honor of Herbert Uhlig, and ACA Brian Cherry Award.",
